            <h3>About This Project</h3>
            <p>I wanted to have somewhere to house some of my photography so I built this website in JavaScript using React for the frontend and Node.js for the backend as a portfolio project and for practice working with the MERN stack.</p>
            <p>The features of this site are definitely not revolutionary, but it works and I wanted something to show for the time I've put into self study of full stack development - progress over perfection.</p>
            <p>The majority of what you'll see here were taken in New Zealand while I thru-hiked Te Araroa or my stint of vanlife between 2021 and 2022.</p>
